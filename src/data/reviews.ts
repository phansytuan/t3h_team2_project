    comment: 'This villa exceeded all our expectations! The views are even more breathtaking in person, and the infinity pool was the highlight of our stay. Emily was an exceptional host, providing fantastic local recommendations and ensuring we had everything we needed. The beach access made for incredible morning walks. We\'re already planning our return visit!'

    comment: 'Perfect getaway for our anniversary. The villa is luxurious in every detail, from the high-end appliances to the comfortable bedding. Watching the sunset from the infinity pool was magical. The location is private yet close enough to great restaurants and activities. Emily was responsive and made our stay special with a welcome bottle of champagne. Highly recommend!'

    comment: 'Beautiful property with amazing ocean views. The villa is spacious and well-appointed. We enjoyed cooking in the gourmet kitchen and dining on the terrace. The only minor issue was some construction noise from a neighboring property during our stay, but Emily was very apologetic and offered a partial refund for the inconvenience. Would definitely stay again!'

    comment: 'This place is a slice of paradise! We stayed here for a family reunion and it was perfect for our group of 8. The bedrooms are spacious and the common areas allowed for both gathering together and finding quiet spaces. The direct beach access was incredible - we spent hours each day enjoying the ocean. Emily provided excellent service and even helped arrange a private chef for one night. Can\'t wait to come back!'

    comment: 'The mountain cabin was everything we hoped for and more! The views were spectacular and the hot tub under the stars was magical. Michael was an attentive host and made sure we had everything we needed. The cabin is beautifully decorated and has all the modern amenities while still feeling cozy and rustic. Perfect winter getaway!'

    comment: 'Great cabin with beautiful views. We loved the fireplace and hot tub. The kitchen was well-equipped for cooking meals. Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was that the driveway was quite steep and difficult to navigate in the snow, even with our 4x4. Michael did warn us about this though and was very helpful with suggestions. Would stay again in the summer!'

The space is beautifully designed and the location is perfect - walking distance to great restaurants, shops, and public transit. Sophia was a fantastic host, providing local recommendations and responding quickly to our questions. Would definitely stay here again!'

    comment: 'We fell in love with this charming cottage! The garden is absolutely beautiful and was the perfect spot for morning coffee. The interior is thoughtfully decorated with a great mix of historic charm and modern comforts. James was an excellent host, providing a detailed guide to the area and quick responses to our questions. The location is ideal for exploring Charleston - we walked everywhere. Highly recommend!'
